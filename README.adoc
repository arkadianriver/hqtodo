A li'l web app (page) to display todo items that are created with
the Todo+ extension for VS Code or the Plaintasks package for Sublime Text.
The open items are shown as a
https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gantt[Mermaid]
Gantt chart with completed items in a list underneath.
Tasks always shift with time, starting from now into the future.
It's meant for todos knocked out at a regular story point velocity per day
and labeled in a particular way.

== Run

Requires NodeJS v12. (It uses the relatively new Map Object type).

Edit the `config/default.json` file with your information.
You can put the TODO file anywhere on the file system the app can access
such as a shared Cloud or Network mounted folder.

Then, install and launch:

[source, bash]
----
npm install
npm start
----

////
== Deploy

For example with `systemd` on Linux:

[source,bash]
----
vi misc/hqtodo.service # change the absolute paths and user
sudo cp misc/hqtodo.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl start hqtodo
sudo journalctl -f # to verify. Also test in a browser
sudo systemctl enable hqtodo
----
////

== Use

Everything in the TODO file is ignored except what's between the `Todos:` project and the `Notes:`
project. (See the sample `TODO` file.)

For the app to work, there's a simple pattern to follow for the Todo items:

[source,bash]
----
☐ [@today|@high|@low] <title text> [@Nh] [@customtag ]*
----

* Priority tagging:
** `@today` items are placed in order in the "`In Progress`" section.
** Items with no priority label are listed in order in the "`Backlog`" section.
** `@high` items are colored red.
** `@low` items are not displayed. (This is your Icebox.)
* The optional `@Nh` tag indicates your estimated N hours. No tag gets the default of 2 hours.
* You can provide any number of `@customtag` for your own custom filtering.
  They're simply displayed with the title.
* When you press `Ctrl-D` to mark a task with a checkmark and a `@done` tag, it's listed
  in the "`Recently closed todos`" section of the web page.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
☐ @high Work with so-and-so on such-and-such @4h @prja @prjb
----

Away for a few days?

You can let folks know about vacations and other "`interruptions to your steady velocity.`"
Those items have a really special format.

[source,bash]
----
☐ [Nd starting YYYY-MM-DD] <title>
----

Example:

[source,bash]
----
☐ [5d starting 2020-05-18] Whiz-Bang-Boom conference
----
