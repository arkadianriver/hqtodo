If you love keyboard shortcuts and things like Org mode,
you might like hqTodo to present your complete agile workflow from one easily editable Todo list in VS Code.
Rather than drag cards around and click and open various windows,
use Fabio Spampinato's
link:https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-todo-plus[TODO+ extension]
to capture status, categories, and estimates as individual todo items in a text file,
with keyboard shortcuts to prioritize and close issues.
His extension is awesome, and with this li'l hqTodo web app,
all that information is summarized in an easily consumable report for you
(and your team if you want).

== Features

- Open items and their estimates are used to display a
https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gantt[Mermaid]
Gantt chart.
Tasks shift with time, starting from now into the future,
providing a quick glimpse of probable completion dates.
- https://apexcharts.com/[ApexCharts] is used to display cumulative story points
you've knocked out to help keep track of your velocity.
- If you field support questions, you can also track those with the TODO+ extension
and view the cumulative time spent in the chart.
- Completed items are displayed underneath. Great for weekly status reports.
- Tag your items to provide a detailed status page for each project.
- Because everyone else uses other forms of tracking,
I use the
link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ragnoroct.linkme[Link Me extension]
to include shortcuts to all those other resources in my Todo list.
The hqTodo app exposes those links, too.

== Running the app

*Prereq:* NodeJS v12 or higher.

. Set things up.
.. Copy the `config/default.json` file to `config/production.json`
and add your info to the new file.
Your own TODO file can be anywhere on the file system the app can access,
such as a shared Cloud or Network mounted folder.
.. Install server dependencies:
+
[source, bash]
----
npm install
----
.. Install client dependencies and build it:
+
[source, bash]
----
cd client-react-carbon
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
----
. Thereafter, run the app with ...
+
[source, bash]
----
./run
----
+
\... and point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
+
kbd:[Ctrl+C] stops the server.

One way to deploy the app in "production" is to run it on a server
with pm2, systemctl, etc.,
and add your TODO file to a folder on the server that's
synced with your local workstation with SyncThing or similar
cloud folder sync application.

////
== Deploy

For example with `systemd` on Linux:

[source,bash]
----
vi misc/hqtodo.service # change the absolute paths and user
sudo cp misc/hqtodo.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl start hqtodo
sudo journalctl -f # to verify. Also test in a browser
sudo systemctl enable hqtodo
----

== Maintaining your todo file

For the most part,
link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus#usage[update your TODO file]
as you normally would.
There are a few conventions to use for the app to work.
link:TODO[See the sample `TODO` file]
as an example.

Everything in your TODO file is ignored except ...

* the list in the optional `Taginfo:` section
* the todo items between the `Todos:` project and the next _top-level_ project.
* the todo items after `Archive:`

\... where a todo item is a line starting with ☐ or ✔.

=== Active todo items

Syntax:

[source,bash]
----
☐ [@today|@high|@low] <todo description> [@Nh] [@custom ]*
----

* Priority tagging:
** Items prefixed with `@today` are placed in order in the "`In Progress`" section.
** Items with no priority label are listed in order in the "`Backlog`" section.
** Items prefixed with `@high` are colored red.
** Items prefixed with `@low` are not displayed. (This is your Icebox.)
* The optional `@Nh` tag indicates your estimated N hours. No tag gets the default of 2 hours.
* You can provide any number of `@custom` tags for your own custom filtering.
  They're simply displayed with the title.
* When you press kbd:[Super+D] to mark a task with a checkmark and a `@done` tag, it's listed
  in the "`Recently closed todos`" section of the web page.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
☐ @high Work with so-and-so on such-and-such @4h @prja @prjb
----

=== Interruptions

You can let folks know about vacations and other "`interruptions`"
to your steady velocity.
Specify the duration and start date as business days only.

Syntax:

[source,bash]
----
☐ [Nd starting YYYY-MM-DD]: <title>
----

Example:

[source,bash]
----
☐ [5d starting 2020-05-18]: Whiz-Bang-Boom conference
----

=== Milestones

Milestones have the same form as an interrupt, but with a length
of zero days (`0d`).

Example:

[source,bash]
----
☐ [0d starting 2020-06-15]: Complete Project A @proja
----

Milestones show up in their own section above the others.

=== Referencing a GitHub repo

If you reference a particular issue in your todo text
(for example if you use the linkme VS Code extension),
the Gantt chart will link to the issue from the task bar and todo text.

Edit the config file repo URL to point to your own repo.
As set up now, it has two patterns:

* one pattern that links to the default repo that you specify in the config file `ghihq•4`
* one pattern that links to whatever repo you specify in the todo file itself
`ghi•ragnoroct/linkme•9`

You can of course change the patterns to link to whatever you want.

=== Archived todos

If you archive your done items (e.g. kbd:[Cmd+Shift+A]]), they will be available at
the bottom along with a graph of the cumulative story points you've knocked out
over time. Marvel at your progress!

TIP: Use category tags in your todo items to see them grouped and totaled by category.

=== The taginfo section

Use this section if you want to provide a more descriptive title
and link to more information on the project.

The structure of each entry:

[source,bash]
----
☐ @tagname full title of the project or category - url or linkme link
----

Example:

[source,bash]
----
☐ @prja Project A - den•bRNzBMOVaqYl6i7C.html
----

I personally link to pages published with link:https://dendron.so[Dendron],
because I like to also use VS Code for my note taking,
and Dendron has a cool feature where you can publish Notes to a web site.
